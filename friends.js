/*
Directions:

In your Mod 0 directory, create a new directory called pairing_2. 
Inside of that directory, touch a file called friends. 
Initialize a Git repository.
Define a variable named arrays that stores an Array of 5 Strings with 
friends names.
Write code to print the third element.
Write code to print the last element.
Write code to print the first element.
Run the file in the Terminal to verify your code is working as expected.
Create a GitHub repository.
Push your work from the local repository to the remote repository.
Define another variable that stores an Array of 5 Strings, with names of 
places to visit.
Use one of the Array methods to do something to that new Array - you choose!
Run the file in the Terminal to verify your code is working as expected.
Push that new work up to the remote repository.
